**Title**

Fyleria

**High Concept**

Fyleria is an epic fantasy experience about a small band of misfits embarking on a quest to save the last heir to the elven crown. Along the way are countless dangers, adventure, and treasure. But perhaps most valuable is unraveling the mystery that brings them all together, and what secrets they are hiding.

**Game Engine**

The game engine will consist of Unity 2D. On top of this, the game will contain various systems and custom libraries made for the game.

**Gameplay**

* The player is introduced to the world of Fyleria during a tense and exciting opening tutorial. After that they are given the opportunity to create and play a character of their own. They can choose from a variety of customization options, and select a mysterious background ability that varies depending on their answers to a short quiz.
* Once they have a character they can be introduced back into the game flow where they will fight a variety of foes and come across quite a few interesting companions. The story begins to draw players in, and the characters are compelling and mysterious with the occasional bit of humor or romance. The further it goes, the greater the danger.
* Players can also learn more of the story by sporadic segments where they can control the captured elven princess, as well as the vampire countess who holds her hostage.
* Replay is moderate to high, given that hidden characters can be unlocked and new starting abilities can be chosen from the quiz. Or possibly a replay feature that allows you to start the game over with an existing character and gain party members at the same level as your prior game.
* Hidden characters could be available from the start.

**Features**

* Episodic story split over several segments.
* At least 5-10 hour game time per episode.
* Simple to understand yet expansive battle system incorporating powers, magic, weapons, armor, and artifacts.
* Multiple side quests allowing for additional hidden characters to be unlocked, extra treasure, powerful artifacts, and extra story.
* A compelling story that introduces players to the land of Fyleria in epic fashion.
* A variety of companions with engrossing backgrounds and hidden secrets that are revealed through continued interaction throughout the game.
* Replayability by having a robust leveling system that allows higher difficulties for additional playthroughs.
* Ability to run through previous episodes with characters in separate “New Game+” modes.
* Various sequences where the player takes control of characters in other parts of the world for glimpses into hidden parts of the story.

**Setting**

* The game takes place in the land of Fyleria.
* A medieval world where multiple kingdoms of various races have banded together in a desperate attempt to stave off the overwhelming undead army that threatens to invade and conquer them all.
* Environments include an elven palace, the town of Bluebrook, caves, forests, underground crypts, a secret vampire lair, a magic power (which can be portable), and residential places like cottages.

**Story**

Refer to Goddess Rising novel. It will be heavily based on this. The story will also take place over several episodes.

**Starting the Game**

The player starts out playing Shyla through a tutorial as she tries to escape Mordred, with Captain Elatain of the royal guard guiding her and serving as a member of her party.

After that player is guided through a section where they design their own character before embarking into the world where they will find a variety of companions. After meeting that third companion Fayth, they are drawn into the quest to to rescue Mysti (and unknowingly Shyla).

**Target Audience**

The target audience for the game is geared towards young adults, teens, and adults who have a love and enthusiasm for playing RPGs. The theme of the game is a throwback to the older RPGs in the Super Nintendo era and we believe there is still a strong market for this type of game. We are aiming for an ESRB rating of “T (Teen)”. The reason for this is we expect there to be some animated violence and suggestive themes, and at least moderate use of strong language; however the game will not have a lot of profanity. There might be some gambling related scenes or areas related to drinking as well.

**Target Platform**

The target platform is a home computer capable of running Unity 2D. In the future, other platforms that Unity 2D supports would be possible.

**Art & Media Assets**

Art and media assets will be designed first in a way to make a workable prototype. Once the game is in a playable state, it will all be compiled into a bible that can be handed off to a contracted artist and/or musician.
