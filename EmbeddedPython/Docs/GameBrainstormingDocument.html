        <p><b>General ideas</b> </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skill books that give people small stat boosts (like the potions that increase +1 DEF, etc)</li>

            <li>Bestiary to look at every enemy (like pokedex?)</li>
            <li>Bonus enemies that are super powerful</li>
            <li>Difficulty settings, one that has enemies that level with you</li>

        <p><b>Battle system examples</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frontal view battle system (Lufia, Dragon Warrior, Wizardry)</li>
            <li>Linear motion battle system (Tales series)</li>
            <li>Sideline turn battle system (FF1-3)</li>
            <li>Active time battle system (FF4-6, Grandia)</li>
            <li>Full action battle system (Star Ocean)</li>
            <li>Strategy battle system (Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts)</li>
            <li>Military battle system (Fire Emblem, Super Robot Wars)</li>
            <li>Duel battle system (Pokemon, Yu-gi-oh)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p><b>Battle system ideas</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple enough that it can be completed within 6-12 months or less</li>
            <li>Turn based system, not active</li>
            <li>Based on speed of character, maybe can go more than once before the enemy can go</li>
            <li>Timeline bar like Grandia (or FFX) where you see the time meter and who is going to go next</li>
            <li>Have it stop on your turn to open a window on what you will do?</li>
            <li>2-3 characters fighting at a time, if a character drops, they can be replaced</li>
            <li>Priority queue for your party that you set up ahead of time</li>
            <li>Experience can be only gotten for characters that participated</li>
            <li>Pull back a character and lose the turn you are on (counts as an action)</li>
            <li>If the whole party is downed, then maybe they get captured?</li>
            <li>Move over to a scene where they have to escape?</li>
            <li>Enemies can capture downed characters and they cannot be revived or healed until the battle is won.</li>
            <li>Want to make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen often for people who are constantly losing battles -- could be jarring to see the same thing if you aren&rsquo;t doing well</li>
            <li>Storyline wise it could help because it adds extra time for scenes</li>
            <li>Non captured characters are the ones who have to travel somewhere to break them out?</li>
            <li>Battle skills could be supplanted with breakout skills, like D&amp;D</li>
            <li>Some enemy groups have higher or lower capture chance</li>
            <li>Some enemies have absolutely no capture, and have it be a ratio so that people cannot always know</li>
            <li>Decrease the capture likelihood with higher difficulty settings</li>
            <li>Have unique battle elements that tie into and support the story (fight back for the portal in CH 1 and 2)</li>
            <li>Switch between different battles</li>
            <li>Nested battles that affect the outcomes of other battles (we heard you liked battles, so we put battles in your battles, so you could battle while you battle).</li>
            <li>Relationship system relates to ability effects, powers, if they die or are close to death, they could get boosts (scream out, etc). This could start with a crit boost to be simple</li>
            <li>Allow players to construct plans, perhaps at the risk of them going wrong</li>
            <li>Customizable main attack</li>
            <li>A few characters can do this</li>
            <li>Two part component, earn new components with leveling</li>
            <li>Characters can combine skills into shortcuts, like in Star Ocean.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>They have slots, and basic attacks.</li>
                <li>This was for a live action battle system</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Characters could have a special ability that prevents them from dying or being downed</li>
            <li>Passive effects, like the ones in FF6, if the health is 1-2% of total</li>
            <li>Concept of what it will look like</li>
            <li>You can move freely before committing to the attack you are using.</li>
            <li>Some attacks can only be used at range or close up.</li>
            <li>After attack, you are committed to the spot where you are standing.</li>
            <li>Timeline like Grandia: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KLgbzvm4O4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KLgbzvm4O4</a> </li>
            <li>Battles are like Final Fantasy where the people are taking turns on a battle bar timeline, but visually they are moving towards the sprites if they are attacking them.</li>
            <li>Timeline battle bar</li>
            <li>Wait bars, maybe 2 or 3, or just the whole section</li>
            <li>End of command bar means that they are able to enter commands</li>
            <li>From command to execution, they still have a time to get to the execution</li>
            <li>Sword attacks could go from command to execution very fast</li>
            <li>Spells could take a bit longer</li>
            <li>Preview of how long your command is going to take to get to execution</li>
            <li>More badass abilities take longer to use</li>
            <li>The look and feel of the battle system</li>
            <li>Players and enemies intermix their location based on who or what they&rsquo;ve attacked.</li>
            <li>Sprites have different states of animation and statuses.</li>
            <li>The sprites move into a background depth but it is literally just the sprites moving up and down, and scaling them down/up so they look like they are moving into the background.</li>
            <li>Battle bar with timeline (it destroys all)</li>
            <li>Character portraits with basic information (health, magic, level)</li>
            <li>Action selection window (Attack, Magic/Power, Item, Defend, Retreat)</li>
            <li>Magic/Power selection window</li>
            <li>Item selection window</li>
            <li>Targeting rectangle to select enemies</li>
            <li>Animations for magic or powers</li>
            <li>Dialogue box for names of enemies, characters as they are selected</li>
            <li>Dialogue box for speech bubbles in battle</li>
            <li>Dialogue box for victory screen and what they earned</li>
            <li>Sprites of characters don&rsquo;t change unless story makes it necessary</li>
            <li>Character progression could be based on a random list constructed at the beginning.</li>
            <li>Or it could be a very simplified skill tree, maybe get skill points where you can &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; a spell or skill that is something they could learn but they cannot learn everything, and have prerequisites. Like feats in D&amp;D.</li>
            <li>We need to write a bunch of use cases that detail each step in various uses of the battle system.</li>
            <li>Design one to two custom characters</li>
            <li>Add in unlocked characters from future games</li>
            <li>Side quests that will offer various challenges to give you an easter egg character</li>
            <li>Character progression data will be saved and can be imported into newer games and when they show up they have the same stats later on, but don&rsquo;t get them unlocked from the start of the new game.</li>
        </ul>
